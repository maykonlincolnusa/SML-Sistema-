# Autonomous Enterprise Intelligence Platform (MONCHA)

## Overview
This project presents an autonomous, data-driven intelligence platform designed to integrate all major areas of a company — financial, operational, marketing, and management — into a unified decision-making system powered by Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.

The platform focuses on transforming scattered operational data into actionable insights, enabling organizations to move from reactive management to proactive, predictive, and optimized operations.

## Problem Statement
In many organizations, critical information is fragmented across multiple systems and departments:

- Financial data is isolated from operations  
- Operational issues are handled manually and reactively  
- Marketing decisions lack real-time feedback from execution  
- Management relies on delayed or incomplete reports  

As a result:
- Decision-making is slow  
- Risks are identified too late  
- Operational inefficiencies persist  
- Strategic planning lacks reliable data support

## Solution Overview
This platform acts as an **enterprise-wide intelligence layer**, integrating data from all business areas and applying AI-driven analysis to support decisions at multiple levels.

Key characteristics:
- Centralized data
